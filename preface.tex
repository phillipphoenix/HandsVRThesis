\begin{quotation}
\textit{Every motion of the hand in every one of its works carries itself through the element of thinking, every bearing of the hand bears itself in that element. All the work of the hand is rooted in thinking. Therefore, thinking itself is man's simplest, and for that reason, hardest handiwork, if it would be accomplished at its proper time.}
