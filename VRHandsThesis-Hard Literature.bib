abstract = {Presence, the sense of being in a virtual environment (VE), is analysed in an embodied cognition framework. We propose that VEs are mentally represented as meshed sets of patterns of actions and that presence is experienced when these actions include the perceived possibility to navigate and move the own body in the VE. A factor analyses of survey data shows 3 different presence components: spatial presence, involvement, and judgement of realness. A path analysis shows that spatial presence is mostly determined by sources of meshed patterns of actions: interaction with the VE, understanding of dynamics, and perception of dramatic meaning.},

abstract = {This paper presents how non-representational views of cognition can inform interaction design as it moves from traditional graphical user interfaces to more bodily forms of interaction such as gesture or movement tracking. We argue that the true value of these “bodily” interfaces is that they can tap our prior skills for interacting in the world. However, these skills are highly non-representational and so traditional representational approaches to interaction design will fail to capture them effectively. We propose interactive machine learning as an alternative approach to interaction design that is able to capture non-representational sensori-motor couplings by allowing people to design by performing actions rather than by representing them. We present an example of this approach applied to designing interactions with video game characters.},

abstract = {This paper raises the question of why movement base inter-action is important in Virtual Reality (VR). This is an im-portant question as new VR hardware is increasingly being released together with movement interfaces. Slater's view is that VR reproduces the sensorimotor contingencies present in our interactions with the real world. This provides a powerful justification, but when the contingencies are not perfectly re-produced, they can result in interfaces that lack important fea-tures of established interaction design: discoverability mem-orability, and feedback. However, Embodied Cognition sug-gests that these imperfect reproductions can still have value if they allow us to reproduce our cognitive and emotional en-gagement with the world and our movements.},

@article{Armel2003,
abstract = {Subjects perceived touch sensations as arising from a table (or a rubber hand) when both the table (or the rubber hand) and their own real hand were repeatedly tapped and stroked in synchrony with the real hand hidden from view. If the table or rubber hand was then 'injured', subjects displayed a strong skin conductance response (SCR) even though nothing was done to the real hand. Sensations could even be projected to anatomically impossible locations. The illusion was much less vivid, as indicated by subjective reports and SCR, if the real hand was simultaneously visible during stroking, or if the real hand was hidden but touched asynchronously. The fact that the illusion could be significantly diminished when the real hand was simultaneously visible suggests that the illusion and associated SCRs were due to perceptual assimilation of the table (or rubber hand) into one's body image rather than associative conditioning. These experiments demonstrate the malleability of body image and the brain's remarkable capacity for detecting statistical correlations in the sensory input.},

abstract = {We report on an experiment that examined the innuence of anthropomorphism and perceived agency on presence, copresence, and social presence in a virtual en-vironment. The experiment varied the level of anthropomorphism of the image of interactants: high anthropomorphism, low anthropomorphism, or no image. Per-ceived agency was manipulated by telling the participants that the image was either an avatar controlled by a human, or an agent controlled by a computer. The results support the prediction that people respond socially to both human and computer-controlled entities, and that the existence of a virtual image increases tele-presence. Participants interacting with the less-anthropomorphic image reported more copresence and social presence than those interacting with partners repre-sented by either no image at all or by a highly anthropomorphic image of the other, indicating that the more anthropomorphic images set up higher expectations that lead to reduced presence when these expectations were not met.},

abstract = {What does it feel like to own, to control, and to be inside a body? The multidimen-sional nature of this experience together with the continuous presence of one's biolog-ical body, render both theoretical and experimental approaches problematic. Never-theless, exploitation of immersive virtual reality has allowed a reframing of this question to whether it is possible to experience the same sensations towards a virtual body inside an immersive virtual environment as toward the biological body, and if so, to what extent. The current paper addresses these issues by referring to the Sense of Embodiment (SoE). Due to the conceptual confusion around this sense, we provide a working definition which states that SoE consists of three subcomponents: the sense of self-location, the sense of agency, and the sense of body ownership. Under this pro-posed structure, measures and experimental manipulations reported in the literature are reviewed and related challenges are outlined. Finally, future experimental studies are proposed to overcome those challenges, toward deepening the concept of SoE and enhancing it in virtual applications.},

abstract = {Gestural interfaces which have been a part of the interface scene are discussed. Gestural systems are no different from any other form of interaction. Some systems are trying to develop a gestural language, sometimes with the number of touch points as a meta-signal about the scope of the movement. Gesture and touch-based systems are already so well accepted that people make gestures to systems that do not understand them such as tapping the screens of non-touch sensitive displays, pinching and expanding the fingers or sliding the finger across the screen on systems that do not support these actions, and for that matter and waving hands in front of sinks that use old-fashioned handles. Gestural systems are indeed one of the important future paths for a more holistic, human interaction of people with technology.},

abstract = {Normal subjects traced sagittal lines on a graphic tablet using a stylus held in their right hand. The hand was hidden by a mirror in which they saw the lines projected from a computer screen. In normal trials, the line seen in the mirror exactly corresponded to the traced line. In perturbed trials, a bias was introduced by the computer, so that the line appeared to deviate in one direction (right or left) by a variable angle (2, 5, 7 or 10??). Subjects consistently displaced their hand in the opposite direction for producing a visually sagittal line. After each trial, they were asked in which direction they thought their hand had moved. In perturbed trials, they grossly underestimated the hand deviation. In addition, a post-hoc analysis revealed that one group of subjects misperceived the direction of their hand movement in the direction opposite to the perturbation (Group 1, including 9 Ss), whereas the other group gave responses in the correct direction (Group 2, including 4 Ss). In a second session using the same experimental paradigm, a motor response was asked for: subjects had to indicate the perceived direction of their hand during each trial by drawing a line with their eyes closed. Again, responses indicated a poor conscious monitoring of motor performance. These results suggest that normal subjects are not aware of signals generated by their own movements.},

@article{Sanchez-Vives2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our body schema gives the subjective impression of being highly stable. However, a number of easily-evoked illusions illustrate its remarkable malleability. In the rubber-hand illusion, illusory ownership of a rubber-hand is evoked by synchronous visual and tactile stimulation on a visible rubber arm and on the hidden real arm. Ownership is concurrent with a proprioceptive illusion of displacement of the arm position towards the fake arm. We have previously shown that this illusion of ownership plus the proprioceptive displacement also occurs towards a virtual 3D projection of an arm when the appropriate synchronous visuotactile stimulation is provided. Our objective here was to explore whether these illusions (ownership and proprioceptive displacement) can be induced by only synchronous visuomotor stimulation, in the absence of tactile stimulation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To achieve this we used a data-glove that uses sensors transmitting the positions of fingers to a virtually projected hand in the synchronous but not in the asynchronous condition. The illusion of ownership was measured by means of questionnaires. Questions related to ownership gave significantly larger values for the synchronous than for the asynchronous condition. Proprioceptive displacement provided an objective measure of the illusion and had a median value of 3.5 cm difference between the synchronous and asynchronous conditions. In addition, the correlation between the feeling of ownership of the virtual arm and the size of the drift was significant. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that synchrony between visual and proprioceptive information along with motor activity is able to induce an illusion of ownership over a virtual arm. This has implications regarding the brain mechanisms underlying body ownership as well as the use of virtual bodies in therapies and rehabilitation.},

@article{Botvinick1998,
abstract = {The question of how we attribute observed body parts as our own, and the consequences of this attribution on our sensory-motor processes, is fundamental to understand how our brain distinguishes between self and other. Previous studies have identified interactions between the illusion of ownership, and multi-sensory integration and cross-sensory predictions by the brain. Here we show that illusory ownership additionally modifies the motor-sensory predictions by the brain. In our preliminary experiments, we observed a new numbness illusion following the classical rubber-hand illusion (RHI); brushing only the rubber hand after induction of the RHI results in illusory numbness in one's real hand. Previous studies have shown that self-generated actions (like tickling) are attenuated by motor-sensory predictions by the so-called forward model . Motivated by this finding, here we examined whether the numbness illusion after the RHI is different when the rubber hand is brushed oneself, compared with when the brushing is performed by another. We observed that, all other conditions remaining the same, haptic perception in the real hand was lower (numbness higher) during self-generated brushing. Our result suggests that RHI reorganizes the forward model, such that we predict haptic consequences of self-generated motor actions on the rubber hand.},

@article{Slater2009,
abstract = {In this paper we address the question as to why participants tend to respond realistically to situations and events portrayed within an Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) system. The idea is put forward, based on experience of a large number of experimental studies, that there are two orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic response. The first is 'being there', often called 'presence', the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this Place Illusion (PI). Second, Plausibility Illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that that they are not 'there' and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, and the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality. .},

abstract = {Mich{\"{a}} el Trico UPMC Anatole ecuyer Inria Rennes Figure 1: The presented experiment assessed the sense of embodiment when interacting with virtual hands with different levels of realism. (Left) Participants performed a series of pick-and-place tasks avoiding different obstacles (the iconic virtual hand and the " fire " obstacle are depicted). (Right) Additionally, participants performed a task in which the virtual hand was potentially threatened by a spinning saw. ABSTRACT How do people appropriate their virtual hand representation when interacting in virtual environments? In order to answer this ques-tion, we conducted an experiment studying the sense of embodi-ment when interacting with three different virtual hand representa-tions, each one providing a different degree of visual realism but keeping the same control mechanism. The main experimental task was a Pick-and-Place task in which participants had to grasp a vir-tual cube and place it to an indicated position while avoiding an obstacle (brick, barbed wire or fire). An additional task was consid-ered in which participants had to perform a potentially dangerous operation towards their virtual hand: place their virtual hand close to a virtual spinning saw. Both qualitative measures and question-naire data were gathered in order to assess the sense of agency and ownership towards each virtual hand. Results show that the sense of agency is stronger for less realistic virtual hands which also provide less mismatch between the participant's actions and the animation of the virtual hand. In contrast, the sense of ownership is increased for the human virtual hand which provides a direct mapping be-tween the degrees of freedom of the real and virtual hand.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) is starting to be used in psychological therapy around the world. How-ever, a thorough understanding of the reason why VR is effective and what effect it has on the human psyche is still missing. Most research on this subject is related to the concept of presence. This paper gives an up-to-date overview of research in this diverse field. It starts with the most prevailing definitions and theories on presence, most of which attribute spe-cial roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space. A re-view of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the rela-tionship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli. An investigation shows there has been substantial research for developing methods for measur-ing presence and research regarding factors that contribute to presence. Knowledge of these contributing factors can play a vital role in development of new VR applications, but key knowledge elements in this area are still missing.},
