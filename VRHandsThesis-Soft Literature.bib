@misc{Apurva2016,
abstract = {"Having a physical body can be very effective in experiences that seek to invoke empathy or sense of play and freedom that comes from assuming an avatar. However, it can also raise dissonance in the Player's mind by trying to nail down gender, body type, age, ethnicity, etc. Naturally as with games, Players can be provided multiple, customizable avatars and also visual representations can be designed that are “neutral” such as robots or aliens. These avatar options that are neutral are void of gender, race and age making them ideal for general purpose characters."},
