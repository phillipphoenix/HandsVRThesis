Virtual Reality (VR) game developers and hardware manufactures seem to be in agreement about the importance of motion control for the medium. Major consumer-oriented VR devices like the HTC Vive and now the Oculus Rift with the Touch Controllers have spatially tracked controllers for this purpose \parencite{htcvive2016, oculus2016}. In the About section of their website, Owlchemy Labs, creators of the critically and commercially \parencite{UnityAwards2016, SteamSpyJobSim} acclaimed Job Simulator: the 2050 archives \parencite{OwlchemyLabs2016} declare:

\begin{displayquote}
\textit{We believe that interaction and using your hands is what truly makes virtual reality the most incredible place to build unique content that blows players minds.} \parencite{aboutOwlchemyLabs}
\end{displayquote}

Immersion and presence, the medium's biggest buzzwords, point us in the right direction. VR is meant to bring us closer than ever before to experiencing virtual environments as if we were actually in them.

Job Simulator was a pioneer giving the player virtual hands they could use to interact with the environment by attaching them to the tracked controllers. It also set a standard in terms of the quality of experience it provided in this regard. By simplifying hard problems and hitting the nail in the head with its humorous tone and aesthetics, it manages to elicit the necessary suspension of disbelief in the player.
