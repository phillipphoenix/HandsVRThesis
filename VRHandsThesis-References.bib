abstract = {There are myriad ways to move in VR, however, based on Atakote Studios' work, they will break down locomotion to 6 fundamental categories or "types" of locomotion to think about today. This talk will cover these types of locomotion, what the most commonly used locomotion mechanics are today, how to test whether a particular type of locomotion is 'good', how to test multiple mechanics effectively and quickly and lastly, which locomotion mechanic is most suitable for you.},

abstract = {Design
Overview	Building an original VR title from the ground up for multiple high-end platforms is incredibly tough. Doing so while these platforms are still being defined and developed is even more daunting. Developing for new platforms is not simply a technical endeavor. In fact, devs needs to consider aspects such as conference demoability, pricing strategy, trailer creation, design variations between platforms, and more. The developers of the HTC Vive / PlayStation VR / Oculus Touch launch title 'Job Simulator' will analyze the challenges of building, sharing, shipping, and sustaining cross-platform VR content, with examples showing both successful and less-than-successful design prototypes and how iteration led to the final product. Additionally, the team will touch on designing, prototyping and iterating on game design, sharing content (YouTube, Twitch, etc), shipping games under significant budget constraints, and overall lessons learned from a tech, design, and production perspective.},
