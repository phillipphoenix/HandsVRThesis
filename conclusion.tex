Conclusion: Adjusted hand control models are worth exploring (others are already doing it, results were positive although testing was insufficient and there were confounding factors, theory supports hypothesis)

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futureWork}

\begin{itemize}
\item Testing with established presence evaluation methods.
\item Grip altering position of hand instead of only fingers
\item Rotation improvements and stability. Non-kinematic rigidbody shortcut gives us things for free, but doesn't allow us enough control. Serves as proof of concept.
\item Methodology reflection?
\end{itemize}
