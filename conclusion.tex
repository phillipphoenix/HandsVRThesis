Conclusion: Adjusted hand control models are worth exploring (others are already doing it, results were positive although testing was insufficient and there were confounding factors, theory supports hypothesis)

Controlled experiments were too unfocused. Compared versions should have been only different one sense: whether they were unadjusted or adjusted hand control models.

Test environments could be iterated on in order to increase the frequency with which the users engaged in the actions that we wanted them to experience.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futureWork}

\begin{itemize}
\item Testing with established presence evaluation methods.
\item Grip altering position of hand instead of only fingers
\item Rotation improvements and stability. Non-kinematic rigidbody shortcut gives us things for free, but doesn't allow us enough control. Serves as proof of concept.
\item Methodology reflection?
\end{itemize}
