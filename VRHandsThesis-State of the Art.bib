Players can climb over anything they can see, then push off and gently sail in any direction. This presentation shows the techniques developed to create a fully animated first person VR character that can climb and crawl across arbitrary surfaces. This session will discuss the constraint system that drives all player locomotion and outline the implementation of our first person animation systems. It will also detail how the team at Ready at Dawn procedurally generated hand animations to allow grabbing arbitrary surfaces.},

abstract = {Design
Overview	Building an original VR title from the ground up for multiple high-end platforms is incredibly tough. Doing so while these platforms are still being defined and developed is even more daunting. Developing for new platforms is not simply a technical endeavor. In fact, devs needs to consider aspects such as conference demoability, pricing strategy, trailer creation, design variations between platforms, and more. The developers of the HTC Vive / PlayStation VR / Oculus Touch launch title 'Job Simulator' will analyze the challenges of building, sharing, shipping, and sustaining cross-platform VR content, with examples showing both successful and less-than-successful design prototypes and how iteration led to the final product. Additionally, the team will touch on designing, prototyping and iterating on game design, sharing content (YouTube, Twitch, etc), shipping games under significant budget constraints, and overall lessons learned from a tech, design, and production perspective.},
