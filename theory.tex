In the previous chapter the terms "immersion", "presence" (and "hand presence") and even "virtual reality" are used in a loose manner. In academia, however, these terms are problematic because of the wide range of fields in which they are used, with very specific and not always similar meanings. Here we will frame the virtual environment constraints problem in existing theories and ground these terms in the academic literature.

\section{Definitions}
\label{sec:definitions}

\subsection{Virtual Reality}
\label{subsec:vrDef}

Virtual Reality is frequently thought of in terms of a collection of hardware commonly associated with the term: head mounted displays, tracking devices, etc... \parencite{Steuer1992} argues that the medium needs a definition with an experiential focus, instead of a technological one, for the purposes of various fields of knowledge such as communication researchers and software developers.

Steuer proposes a definition of Virtual Reality based on the concepts of presence and telepresence. Presence is described by Gibson as "the sense of being in an environment" (cited as found in \parencite{Steuer1992}) and in turn Steuer defines telepresence as "the experience of presence in an environment by means of a communication medium". From these terms we can rewrite Steuer's definition of Virtual Reality as follows:

\begin{displayquote}
\textit{A virtual reality is a real or simulated environment in which a perceiver experiences a sense of being in that environment by means of a communication medium.}
\end{displayquote}

The connection between VR hardware such as the HTC Vive, the Oculus Rift or the PS VR and this concept of virtual reality is, of course then, that these devices amplify user's sense of being in virtual environments.

\subsection{Immersion}
\label{subsec:immersion}

As mentioned before, a term used frequently when talking about the VR medium is immersion. Slater defines immersion as a property useful for the comparison of different virtual reality systems. He borrows the concept of sensorimotor contingencies (SC) from behavioural and brain scientists O'Regan and NoÃ«. SCs are the actions that we know we can perform in order to control our perception: bending down and turning our heads in order to see underneath something and further defines Valid Actions of a virtual reality system as the actions that the user can take that result in changes in perception (sensorimotor actions), or changes to the environment (effectual actions) \parencite{Slater2009}. By Slater's definition:

\begin{displayquote}
\textit{Immersion is a property of the Valid Actions that are possible within a system.}
\end{displayquote}

\subsection{Place Illusion and Plausibility Illusion \textit{in lieu of} Presence}
\label{subsec:PIandPsi}

Slater's definition of immersion focuses on the affordances \parencite{Norman} of virtual reality systems (hardware and software combined) and he builds on it to analyze the concept of presence (in Steuer's terms, telepresence), now focusing on the user experience. He proposes using the terms Place Illusion (PI) and Plausibility Illusion (Psi) instead of it \parencite{Slater2009}:

\begin{displayquote}
\textit{Place Illusion is the illusion of being in a place in spite of the sure knowledge that you are not there. PI is related mainly to the physics of virtual situation. "It is maintained through synchronous correlations between the act of moving an concomitant changes in the images that form perception" Slater explains.}
\end{displayquote}

\begin{displayquote}
\textit{Plausibility Illusion is the illusion that what is apparently happening is really happening in spite of the knowledge that it is not. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the user, and the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations.}
\end{displayquote}

Slater developed these concepts in his research about why people in virtual reality tend to respond to situations realistically, which is very relevant when considering virtual reality as a tool for therapy for instance. in some cases, this might go further than the goals that game developers have for the experiences they create, since at least to a certain extent, games depict fairly implausible and unrealistic situations.

According to Slater, PI and Psi fuse when we consider the body. We perceive a virtual body to be in the space where we sense ourselves to be (we look down, it seems we are \textit{there}: strong PI), but it is a body that is not ours and over which in principle we have no control, and yet we move our limbs and the virtual body's limbs move in synchrony (an event in the - initially - external world that relates to us: also Psi).

\subsection{Sense of Embodiment}
\label{subsec:embodiment}

The notion of Sense of Embodiment (SoE), proposed in \parencite{Kilteni2012} is perhaps more useful when thinking about virtual bodies:

\begin{displayquote}
\textit{SoE toward a body B is the sense that emerges when B's properties are processed as if they were the properties of one's own biological body.}
\end{displayquote}

Kilteni et al. describe three subcomponents of SoE:

\begin{displayquote}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Sense of Self-Location: one's spacial experience of being inside a body.}
\item \textit{Sense of Agency: "the sense of having global motor control, including the subjective experience of action, control, intention, motor selection and the consious experience of will"} (Blanke and Metzinger's definition, as cited in \parencite{Kilteni2012})\textit{, resulting from the comparison between the predicted sensory consequences of one's actions and the actual sensory consequences.}
\item \textit{Sense of Body Ownership: one's self attribution of the body, implying the sense that the body is the source of the experienced sensations.}
\end{itemize}
\end{displayquote}
