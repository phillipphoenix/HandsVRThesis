\huge \textbf{Acknowledgements}
\end{center}
We would like to dedicate here a few words in appreciation of the help and support given by our friends and families. Special thanks are due to Anton, Lucas, Peter and Jonathan for sharing their office and good spirits with us, and to Sarah, who listened to Ã“scar ramble about the thesis and let him write from her windowsill. And of course, we thank our supervisors, Martin and Miguel, for their feedback and confidence in us.
